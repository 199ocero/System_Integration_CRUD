# System-Integration-CRUD

1. Find "htdocs" in xammp folder and inside "htdocs" create your own folder where you want to put all your project files.
2. Inside the folder you created copy all the files I uploaded in this repository.
3. Open "Visual Studio Code" and edit the files you want to change.
4. To view your design open xampp control panel. Check Apache and MySQL.
5. In your browser type this: http://localhost/folderyoucreated/index.php
6. Done.


Note: Buttons with icons needed internet to show. If you don't want internet then erase this type of code you can see in the files:
"<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove">"
